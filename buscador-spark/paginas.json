It is one of four months to have 30 [[day]]s.\n\nApril always begins on the same day of the week as [[July]], and additionally, [[January]] in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as [[December]].\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]\nApril comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year.\n\nApril begins on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year and on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year, as each other's last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\n\nIn [[common year]]s, April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[May]] of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as [[July]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[February]] and [[October]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[June]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[March]] and June of the following year.\n\nApril is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.\n\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word \"aperire\", meaning \"to open\", referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].\n\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].\n\n== April in poetry ==\n[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter.

                "__text": "{{monththisyear|8}}\n'''August''' (Aug.) is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. It is named after the Roman emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].\n\nAugust does not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in [[common year]]s, but begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]\nThis month was first called ''Sextilis'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735&nbsp;BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450&nbsp;BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.\n\nAugust is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.<ref name=\"infoplease\">{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}</ref> The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.\n\nAugust, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].\n\nNo other month in [[common year]]s begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.\n\nIn common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[June]] of the previous year.

                "__text": "{{monththisyear|5}}\n'''May''' is the fifth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendars]], coming between [[April]] and [[June]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. The month of May might have been named for the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Maia]], or more likely the Roman [[goddess]] of [[fertility]] [[Bona Dea]], whose festival was held in May.\n\nMay never begins or ends on the same day of the week as any other month.\n\nMay's [[flower]] is the [[Lily of the Valley]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[emerald]]. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:XN Fruehjahrswiese 00.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Flower]]s and [[Tree]]s in full bloom in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where May is in late [[Spring]].]]\nMay comes between [[April]] and [[June]] and is the fifth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It is one of the seven months to have 31 days. In the older [[Roman calendar]], May was the third month of the year. It is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the seasonal equivalent of [[November]] in the other. May is likely to have been named after the Roman [[God|goddess]] [[Maia]], though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin \"Maiores\", meaning \"Seniors\". The same theory suggests that [[June]] would then be named from \"Iuniores\", meaning \"Juniors\".\n\nNo other month of any year either begins or ends on the same day of the week as May: this month is the only one that has both of these properties.\n\nIn common years, May starts on the same day of the week as [[August]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year. In common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as August and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, March and [[June]] of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, May starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] of the previous year. \n\nEvery year, May both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the following year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In years immediately before common years, May starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[April]] and [[July]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as [[February]] and October of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, July of the following year.\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], May is in late [[Spring]], and [[May Day]] on [[May 1]] and [[Walpurgis Night]], during the night of [[April 30]] to [[May 1]], are symbolic of the transition from [[winter]] to [[summer]]. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], it is in [[autumn]], and comes just before the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] winter, when [[emperor penguin]]s breed there.\n{{-}}\n\n== Events in May ==\n\nSpecial devotions to the [[Virgin Mary]] take place in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15459a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> \n\n=== Fixed Events ===\n[[File:Viktualienmarkt Maibaum Nahaufnahme 1999.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A May Tree symbolic of [[May 1]], [[May Day]], in [[Germany]].]]\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-5.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Victory Day celebration in [[Moscow]] on [[May 9]].]]\n[[File:Oslo 17 mai 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Celebration of [[Constitution]] Day in [[Norway]] on [[May 17]].]]\n* [[May 1]] - [[May Day]] in many countries.\n* [[May 1]] - International Workers' Day\n* [[May 1]] - Beltane (neo-[[Paganism|Pagan]] culture)\n* [[May 1]] - Lei Day ([[Hawaii]])\n* [[May 1]] - [[Constitution]] Day in [[Latvia]] and the [[Marshall Islands]]\n* [[May 2]] - Flag Day ([[Poland]])\n* [[May 2]] - National Education Day ([[Indonesia]])\n* [[May 2]] - Teachers' Day in [[Iran]] and [[Bhutan]]\n* [[May 3]] - [[Constitution]] Day ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]])\n* [[May 3]] - Constitution Memorial Day ([[Japan]])\n* [[May 3]] - World Press Freedom Day\n* [[May 4]] - Unofficial [[Star Wars]] Day\n* [[May 4]] - International Firefighters' Day\n* [[May 4]] - Youth Day in [[China]] and [[Fiji]]\n* [[May 4]] - Greenery Day ([[Japan]])\n* [[May 4]] - Remembrance of the Dead ([[Netherlands]])\n* [[May 5]] - Children's Day in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]\n* [[May 5]] - Cinco de Mayo ([[Mexico]] and [[United States]])\n* [[May 5]] - Liberation Day in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]\n* [[May 5]] - Coronation Day ([[Thailand]])\n* [[May 5]] - [[Europe]] Day\n* [[May 6]] - International No [[Diet]] Day\n* [[May 6]] - [[Teacher]]'s Day ([[Jamaica]])\n* [[May 6]] - [[Saint George]]'s Day (Eastern Orthodox countries)\n* [[May 7]] - [[Radio]] Day in [[Russia]] and [[Bulgaria]]\n* [[May 8]] - Victory in Europe Day, marking end of [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]\n* [[May 8]] - International [[Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent]] Day\n* [[May 8]] - Parents' Day ([[South Korea]])\n* [[May 8]] - [[Harry S.

                "__text": "{{monththisyear|5}}\n'''May''' is the fifth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendars]], coming between [[April]] and [[June]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. The month of May might have been named for the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Maia]], or more likely the Roman [[goddess]] of [[fertility]] [[Bona Dea]], whose festival was held in May.\n\nMay never begins or ends on the same day of the week as any other month.\n\nMay's [[flower]] is the [[Lily of the Valley]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[emerald]]. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:XN Fruehjahrswiese 00.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Flower]]s and [[Tree]]s in full bloom in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where May is in late [[Spring]].]]\nMay comes between [[April]] and [[June]] and is the fifth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It is one of the seven months to have 31 days. In the older [[Roman calendar]], May was the third month of the year. It is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the seasonal equivalent of [[November]] in the other. May is likely to have been named after the Roman [[God|goddess]] [[Maia]], though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin \"Maiores\", meaning \"Seniors\". The same theory suggests that [[June]] would then be named from \"Iuniores\", meaning \"Juniors\".\n\nNo other month of any year either begins or ends on the same day of the week as May: this month is the only one that has both of these properties.\n\nIn common years, May starts on the same day of the week as [[August]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year. In common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as August and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, March and [[June]] of the previous year. In leap years and years immediately after that, May starts on the same day of the week as [[February]] of the previous year. \n\nEvery year, May both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as [[January]] of the following year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart. In years immediately before common years, May starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[April]] and [[July]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, May finishes on the same day of the week as [[February]] and October of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, July of the following year.\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], May is in late [[Spring]], and [[May Day]] on [[May 1]] and [[Walpurgis Night]], during the night of [[April 30]] to [[May 1]], are symbolic of the transition from [[winter]] to [[summer]]. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], it is in [[autumn]], and comes just before the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] winter, when [[emperor penguin]]s breed there.\n{{-}}\n\n== Events in May ==\n\nSpecial devotions to the [[Virgin Mary]] take place in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15459a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> \n\n=== Fixed Events ===\n[[File:Viktualienmarkt Maibaum Nahaufnahme 1999.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A May Tree symbolic of [[May 1]], [[May Day]], in [[Germany]].]]\n[[File:2010 Moscow Victory Day Parade-5.jpeg|thumb|150px|right|Victory Day celebration in [[Moscow]] on [[May 9]].]]\n[[File:Oslo 17 mai 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Celebration of [[Constitution]] Day in [[Norway]] on [[May 17]].]]\n* [[May 1]] - [[May Day]] in many countries.\n* [[May 1]] - International Workers' Day\n* [[May 1]] - Beltane (neo-[[Paganism|Pagan]] culture)\n* [[May 1]] - Lei Day ([[Hawaii]])\n* [[May 1]] - [[Constitution]] Day in [[Latvia]] and the [[Marshall Islands]]\n* [[May 2]] - Flag Day ([[Poland]])\n* [[May 2]] - National Education Day ([[Indonesia]])\n* [[May 2]] - Teachers' Day in [[Iran]] and [[Bhutan]]\n* [[May 3]] - [[Constitution]] Day ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]])\n* [[May 3]] - Constitution Memorial Day ([[Japan]])\n* [[May 3]] - World Press Freedom Day\n* [[May 4]] - Unofficial [[Star Wars]] Day\n* [[May 4]] - International Firefighters' Day\n* [[May 4]] - Youth Day in [[China]] and [[Fiji]]\n* [[May 4]] - Greenery Day ([[Japan]])\n* [[May 4]] - Remembrance of the Dead ([[Netherlands]])\n* [[May 5]] - Children's Day in [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]\n* [[May 5]] - Cinco de Mayo ([[Mexico]] and [[United States]])\n* [[May 5]] - Liberation Day in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]]\n* [[May 5]] - Coronation Day ([[Thailand]])\n* [[May 5]] - [[Europe]] Day\n* [[May 6]] - International No [[Diet]] Day\n* [[May 6]] - [[Teacher]]'s Day ([[Jamaica]])\n* [[May 6]] - [[Saint George]]'s Day (Eastern Orthodox countries)\n* [[May 7]] - [[Radio]] Day in [[Russia]] and [[Bulgaria]]\n* [[May 8]] - Victory in Europe Day, marking end of [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]\n* [[May 8]] - International [[Red Cross]] and [[Red Crescent]] Day\n* [[May 8]] - Parents' Day ([[South Korea]])\n* [[May 8]] - [[Harry S.

                "__text": "{{monththisyear|7}}\n'''July''' (Jul.) is the seventh [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[June]] and [[August]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. July was named after [[Julius Caesar]]. The halfway point of the year is either on [[July 2]] or in the night of [[July 1]]-[[July 2|2]].\n\nJuly always begins on the same day of the week as [[April]], and additionally, [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. July does not end on the same day of the week as any other month in [[common year]]s, but ends on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s.\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BC).JPG|thumb|130px|right|July is named after [[Julius Caesar]], who was born on 12 or 13 July]]\nIn each hemisphere, it is the [[season|seasonal]] equivalent of [[January]] in the other hemisphere. In the North, it is [[summer]] and in the South it is [[winter]].\n\nIn the [[Northern Hemisphere]], July is often the warmest month of the year, and major [[sport]]ing events and [[music]] festivals are held around this time. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], it is a winter month, with the [[cold|coldest]]-recorded temperature having been measured in [[Antarctica]] in this month.\n\nJuly begins on the same day of the week as [[April]] every year and on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. No other month in [[common year]]s ends on the same day of the week as July, but July ends on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s.\n\nIn common years, July starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[May]] of the previous year. In common years, July finishes on the same day of the week as [[February]] and October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, July both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, July starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[June]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, July finishes on the same day of the week as [[April]] and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, September of the following year.\n\nJuly's [[flower]] is a variety of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[ruby]]. The meaning for the birthstone ruby is contented mind. [[Astrology|Astrological]] signs for July are [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] ([[June 21]] - [[July 21]]) and [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] ([[July 22]] - [[August 21]]).\n\nIn the old [[Roman calendar]], July was called ''Quintilis'', meaning ''Fifth Month'', because, in the old calendar, the year began in [[March]]. [[Augustus]] later renamed it July in honor of [[Julius Caesar]], whose birthday was in this month. [[Augustus]] later also named the following month, [[August]], after himself.\n{{-}}\n\n== Holidays ==\n=== Fixed Events ===\n[[File:Canada Day 2008 Snowbirds over

                "__text": "{{monththisyear|3}}\n'''March''' (Mar.) is the third [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[February]] and [[April]]. It has 31 days. March is named after [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of war.\n\nMarch always begins on the same day of the week as [[November]], and additionally, [[February]] in [[common year]]s.  March always ends on the same day of the week as [[June]].\n\n== The Month ==\n[[File:Narcissus pseudonarcissus 030405.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[daffodil]] is a symbol of the month of March, when [[spring]] begins in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]\nIn [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], March was called Martius. It was named after the war god ([[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]) and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war. Before [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[calendar]] reform, March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar, as the [[winter]] was considered to be a monthless period. It is one of seven months to have 31 days.\n\nMarch begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[common year]]s and [[November]] every year, as each other's first days are exactly 4 weeks (28 days) and 35 weeks (245 days) apart respectively. March ends on the same day of the week as [[June]] every year, as each other's last days are exactly 13 weeks (91 days) apart.\n\nIn [[common year]]s, March starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s, [[September]] and [[December]] of the previous year. In common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as September of the previous year, and in leap years, [[April]] and December of the previous year.\n\nIn years immediately before common years, March starts on the same day of the week as [[August]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[May]] of the following year. In years immediately before common years, March finishes on the same day of the week as August and November of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, May of the following year.\n\nIn leap years, the day before [[March 1]] is [[February 29]]. This determines the position of each day of the year from there on. As an example, [[March 1]] is usually the 60th day of the year, but in a leap year is the 61st day.\n\nIn terms of [[season]]s, March is one of two months to have an [[equinox]] (the other is [[September]], its seasonal equivalent in both  [[hemisphere]]s), with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours, halfway between the [[December]] and [[June]] [[solstice]]s. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], [[spring]] starts in this month, while it is [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. \n\n== Start of the season ==\n\nThe official start of either season is [[March 1]], though the [[equinox]] can fall on [[March 20]] or [[March 21|21]], occasionally on [[March 19]]. The northern spring equinox marks the start of the [[Iran]]ian [[New Year]] and [[Baha'i]] [[New Year]]. It is from the [[March 21]] date that [[Easter]]'s date is calculated, on the Sunday after the first [[full moon]] in spring, meaning it can fall between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]] in Western [[Christianity]].{{-}} \n\n== Events in March ==\n=== Fixed events ===\n[[File:StDavidsDay.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Saint David's Day]] celebration in [[Cardiff]] Bay, [[Wales]] on [[March 1]].]]\n[[File:HinaSet.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Seven-tiered [[doll]] set celebrating [[Hinamatsuri]], Girls' Day, in [[Japan]] on [[March 3]].]]\n[[File:Frauentag 1914 Heraus mit dem Frauenwahlrecht.jpg|thumb|180px|right|German poster from [[1914]] marking [[International Women's Day]] on [[March 8]].]]\n[[File:Happy Saint Patrick's Day 2010, Dublin, Ireland, Accordion Violin.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Saint Patrick's Day]] celebration in [[Dublin]] on [[March 17]].]]\n[[File:Cesar chavez crop2.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Cesar Chavez]], whose birthday is observed in the [[US]] on [[March 31]].]]\n* [[March 1]] -

Viruses do not appear here because there is no evidence of how they relate to the other three kingdoms of life]]\nAn '''organism''' is an individual [[Life|living]] thing. It is easy to recognize a living thing, but not so easy to define it. [[Animal]]s and [[plant]]s are organisms, obviously. Organisms are a [[biotic]], or living, part of the [[environment]]. Rocks and sunshine are parts of the non-living [[environment]].\n\nOrganisms usually have six basic needs to continue their [[metabolism]]. They need [[air]], [[water]], [[nutrient]] ([[food]]), [[energy]], a place to live, and [[Homeostasis|homeostatsis]] (being able to maintain itself). However, not all living things need all these at the same time. Some organisms do not need access to air at all.\n\nThe characteristics of living things are if they have cells, take and use energy, grow and develop, share similar chemicals, sense and resond to change (stimulus), and if they reproduce.\n\nA little thought is needed about [[viruses]]. There is no agreement as to whether they should be regarded as living. They are made of [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]], and they [[evolution|evolve]], which is a really important fact. However, they exist in two quite different phases. One phase is [[dormancy|dormant]], not active. The other is inside a living [[cell]] of some other organism. Then the virus is very active reproducing itself. Consider the parallel with a [[computer program]]. When in use it is active; when it is not, it is completely inactive. It is still a program all the same.\n\nAnother example from biology is the [[spore]], which is a distribution phase of a [[bacteria]], [[fungus]] or some plants. They are not active until they get to the right situation. They have all the working parts to build a complete organism, but for the moment it is switched off.\n\nSome organisms are made up of millions of [[cell]]s. They are [[multicellular organism]]s. Many can be seen without using a microscope.\n\nMost organisms are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. You need a [[microscope]] to see them. They are called [[microorganism]]s. Organisms can be made up of just one cell. They are called ''[[unicellular organism]]s'' or ''single celled organisms''. Examples include [[bacteria]], and [[protozoa]] such as the ''[[Amoeba]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]''.\n\n==Origin==\nThe [[Tree of life (biology)|Tree of Life]] project works on the relationships between living things. Identifying a [[LUCA]] (last universal common ancestor) is one of its main aims. The LUCA is estimated to have lived some 3.8 [[1,000,000,000|billion]] years ago (sometime in the [[Palaeoarchaean]] [[era]]).<ref>{{Citation | last = Doolittle | first = W.F. | year = 2000 | title = Uprooting the tree of life | url = http://shiva.msu.montana.edu/courses/mb437_537_2005_fall/docs/uprooting.pdf | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 282 | issue = 6 | pages = 90–95 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0200-90 | postscript = . | pmid = 10710791 | bibcode = 2000SciAm.282b..90D | accessdate = 2013-06-06 | archive-date = 2011-01-31 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5w9oPfm4a?url=http://shiva.msu.montana.edu/courses/mb437_537_2005_fall/docs/uprooting.pdf | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>\n{{Citation | last1 = Glansdorff | first1=N. | last2 = Xu | first2=Y | last3 = Labedan | first3 = B. | year = 2008 | title = The last universal common ancestor: emergence, constitution and genetic legacy of an elusive forerunner | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 29 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-3-29 | doi-access=free | postscript = . | pmid = 18613974 | pmc = 2478661}}</ref>\n\n:A universal common ancestor is at least 10<sup>2860</sup> times more probable than having multiple ancestors.<ref name=\"discnews\">{{cite web | last1 = Hesman Saey | first1 = T. | date = 2010 | title = All modern life on Earth derived from common ancestor | url = http://news.discovery.com/animals/life-single-common-ancestor.html | publisher = Discovery News | access-date = 2013-06-06 | archive-date = 2012-08-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120825123255/http://news.discovery.com/animals/life-single-common-ancestor.html | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n:A model with a single common ancestor but allowing for some gene swapping among species was... 10<sup>3489</sup> times more probable than the best multi-ancestor model...<ref name=\"discnews\"/>\nThe idea came from [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', \"Therefore... probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form...\"\n\n==Related pages==\n* [[Earliest known life forms]]\n* [[Origin of life]]\n* [[Morphology (biology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Other websites==\n*{{Official website|http://www.tolweb.org/}}\n*[http://tolweb.org/tree/home.pages/abouttol.html About the Tree of Life Web Project]\n*[http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2007f/zt01668p040.pdf Maddison D.R.

People in the navy are called sailors. The navy is mostly made up of [[warship]]s. It may also have its own [[air force]] and [[soldier]]s. It may have special boats that can go underwater, called [[submarine]]s, or another kind of special boat that is meant to carry [[airplane]]s, called [[aircraft carrier]]s. \n\n== History ==\nOriginally, Naval war was fought by ramming other ships and then jumping onto them to fight the crew. In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the ships were usually powered by [[oar]]s. During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[cannon]] was invented. These could be shot at other ships from a great distance. Warships around this time also began to use [[sail]]s instead of oars for power. In the middle 19th century, ships began to be plated in [[armor]] for protection. [[Steam engine]]s allowed them move while carrying the armor, and better ones soon made them much faster. These early warships, called [[ironclad]]s, are thought to have begun the type of Naval [[war]]fare used today. Ships and guns soon became much larger.\n\n== Related pages ==\n{{commonscat}}\n* [[Royal Navy]]\n* [[United States Navy]]\n* [[Royal Australian Navy]]\n* [[Royal New Zealand Navy]]\n\n== Other websites ==\n\n* [https://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Navy Navy] -Citizendium\n\n\n\n[[Category:Navy| ]]"
